# SteganographyApp

## Project Description
SteganographyApp is a project developed for a hackathon with the theme "Privacy and Online Presence." The application provides a creative and secure way to create passwords and access accounts using images. By transforming images to contain hidden text, parts of those texts can be used as passwords, enhancing security.

## Features
- **Image to Text Conversion**: Convert images to contain hidden text data.
- **Password Generation**: Generate secure passwords from the hidden text within images.
- **User Configuration**: Customize password generation settings, including length and character requirements.
- **Navigation**: Easily navigate through different configuration and option pages.

## Pages and Functionality
- **MainPage**: The main entry point of the application, allowing navigation to different options and configurations.
- **UserConfigPopUp**: A configuration page where users can set preferences for password generation, such as length and character types.
- **OptionAPage**: A page that allows users to upload an image, preview it, and copy the generated password.

## How It Works
1. **Upload Image**: Users can upload an image on the Option A page.
2. **Convert Image**: The application converts the image to contain hidden text data.
3. **Generate Password**: Users can generate a password from the hidden text within the image.
4. **Customize Settings**: Users can customize password generation settings on the User Configuration page.
